# Ford-Fulkerson Family â€“ Max Flow Algorithms

This repository contains an implementation of the **Ford-Fulkerson family of algorithms** for computing the **maximum s-t flow** in a flow network, along with multiple strategies to find augmenting paths.

## Implemented Strategies for Finding Augmenting Paths

- **Fattest Path (Widest Path)**: Chooses the path with the maximum bottleneck capacity.
- **Shortest Path (BFS-based)**: Uses Breadth-First Search to find the shortest augmenting path in terms of number of edges.
- **Randomized DFS**: Uses a randomized Depth-First Search to explore paths.

All strategies are modular and can be passed into the main Ford-Fulkerson function.

## Experimental Analysis

We analyze and compare the performance of each strategy by collecting:

- **Number of Iterations**: Number of augmenting paths found to reach the max flow.
- **Touched Elements**: Total number of vertices and edges visited.
- **Execution Time**: Measured in nanoseconds for higher precision.

These measurements are compared against the **RITT version** using Boost's Push-Relabel algorithm for benchmarking purposes.

## Usage

### Build the Project
```bash
make
```

### Compute Max Flow
Use the main binary to run max flow on a DIMACS-format graph using a chosen strategy:
```bash
./bin/max_flow bfs < graphs/mesh_graph.dimacs
./bin/max_flow dfs < graphs/mesh_graph.dimacs
./bin/max_flow fat < graphs/mesh_graph.dimacs
```

### Generate a Graph Using Professor's C Code
```bash
./bin/gengraph <function_id> <arg1> <arg2> <arg3> <output_file>
```
For example:
```bash
./bin/gengraph 1 50 50 37 > graphs/mesh_graph.dimacs
```

### Run the RITT Version (Boost Push-Relabel)
```bash
./bin/ritt_max_flow < graphs/mesh_graph.dimacs
```

### Benchmark All Implementations
Run all algorithms (bfs, dfs, fat, ritt) on every `.dimacs` file in the graphs folder:
```bash
./scripts/benchmark.sh
```
This creates a CSV file `results.csv` with:
```
graph,strategy,max_flow,time_ns
```

## Notes
- The project uses a `visitedToken` optimization to reduce memory operations when tracking visited nodes.
- Execution times are measured using `date +%s.%N` to ensure nanosecond resolution.
- All augmenting strategies are interchangeable thanks to the `PathFindingStrategy` function pointer abstraction.
